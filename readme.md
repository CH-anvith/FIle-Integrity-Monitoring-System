# A basic FIM
FIM (short for File Integrity Monitor) is a tool that monitors a hostâ€™s local system for changes to specified files, directories, and registry settings to detect illicit modifications. In this basic FIM, it accomplishes its task by calculating file hashes and storing them in a baseline, then the monitoring starts by verifying that the current file state hash is equal to the one stored in our trusted baseline.
